    Before becoming <a href="https://www.roadbotics.com/2022/07/11/michelin-acquires-roadbotics-a-start-up-specialized-in-road-infrastructure-computer-vision/">a Michelin Group company</a>, RoadBotics was a start-up. In order to pursue ambition AI goals while balancing investor interest in using the company's limited funding to become profitable, I helped RoadBotics apply for two Small Business Innovation Research grants.
    <br><br>
    However, before getting into the grants, it's useful to understand the business proposition underlying RoadBotics. In the U.S., many small-to-medium municipalities do not perform regular inspection and inventory of many parts of their outdoor infrastructure (e.g. roads, sidewalks, trees, street signs, etc.) because of how expensive and time consuming it is to do it manually. Although automated solutions exist for inventory and analysis of some parts of public infrastructure (like <a href="https://www.roadscanners.com/products/road-clinic-rdsv/full-rdsv-system-road-data-collection/">scan vans for roads</a>), these services are prohibitively expensive for all except the biggest cities with largest budgets. This means many towns and cities manage their infrastructure on a crisis-by-crisis basis, spending lots money to fix a problem only when it comes becomes a priority because the damage causes citizen outrage or blocks other city services. That pattern could be avoided while spending much less money on upkeep if infrastructure issues are found and patched while they are still small. A good example of this is using sealant to seal cracks on a street, a very fast and cheap operation, that can prevent them from expanding into potholes that require breaking up and repaving entire sections of the road.
    <br><br>
    As a company, RoadBotics' pitch is to develop software-based solutions for infrastructure inspection that are far cheaper than either manual inspections or current automated systems. This was possible by taking the approach of current automated systems (i.e. using sensors to record data at driving speed and analyze it later offline) but moving the burden of analysis from specialized, expensive sensors on a scan van that require frequent maintenance, calibration, and a trained operator to sophisticated computer vision and deep learning algorithms that can provide similar insights from HD smartphone video.

        NSF SBIR Phase I: Leveraging non-optimal data for automated sidewalks assessment and inventory.
      </h3>
      <p>
        The aim of this project was to develop a fully automated tool for sidewalk inventory and assessment. Using computer vision techniques such as 3D reconstruction (see <a href="{% link index.html %}#TalksAndBlogPosts">Blog Posts</a> for preliminary work) and deep learning for automtated detection of obstructions and signs of distress (e.g. cracks), we planned to build a software system that required nothing more than HD video and gps from a smartphone or GoPro camera to build a 3D sidewalk inventory for an entire city, and automatically identify areas where the sidewalk did not meet minimum specifications as set by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
        <br><br>
        Based on the fact that many municipalities do not perform regular inspection and inventory of many parts of their infrastructure (e.g. roads and sidewalks) because of how expensive and time consuming it is to do it manually, we hoped to develop a software-based solution that was faster and cheaper than manual performing manual inspections. 

        that required very little in the form of upfront hardware costs (i.e. they just need a modern smartphone or GoPro) and would be far faster (and therefore less exp)
